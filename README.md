# FT_CONTAINERS-2022
Ft-containers graded 100 by my peers on October 2, 2022. Tested on linux.

## In the repo: 
- containers:
  - contain the 3 containers with the iterators and a Red and Black Tree
- utiles: 
  - other reimplemented templates used to reimplement the containers
- tests:
  - [vector, map, stack]
    - my[vector, map, stack]: files testing all functions in the containers with my reimplementation
    - real[vector, map, stack]: files testing all function with the real containers

## Usage: 
To test: 
`git clone`
`cd tests/[vector, map, stack]`
`./test[vector, map, stack]`

if there are no diff, my ft [vector, map, stack] = std [vector, map, stack]
